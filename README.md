Private-Events is similar to EventBrite, which allows users to create events and then manage attendee signups. Events take place at a specific date and location.

This project was part of The Odin Projectâ€™s Ruby on Rails [Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/associations). It contains bare-bones authentication and limited resource actions as the project mainly focused on building up my working experience with ActiveRecord Associations, particularly many-to-many relationships. Working through this project also helped me familiarize myself with foreign keys, class names and sources.
